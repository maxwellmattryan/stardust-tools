# Funds Spreader

The funds spreader tool requests funds from a faucet to a set of addresses at given account and address indices, of a given address derivation path and address encoding scheme.

Please [see below](#parameters) for more detail on the available parameters.

:::caution
The tool does **NOT** currently work for the IOTA devnet.
:::

## What to Use For

This is useful to test finding "balances" where the funds may reside on addresses, many indices apart. If you wish to put funds on address index `9_999_999` then you certainly can ðŸ™‚

## How to Use

### Before Using

Before using the funds spreader, you **MUST** configure your `.env` file:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file located in [`stardust-tools/tools/funds-spreader/.env.example`](https://github.com/maxwellmattryan/stardust-tools/blob/develop/tools/funds-spreader/.env.example){target=\_blank} and rename to `.env`
2. Fill in each line where there is a blank string with a mnemonic (ideally different ones but could also be the same)

```bash
# stardust-tools/tools/funds-spreader/.env

MNEMONIC_001="kind kidney lottery soon ball trade nest interest latin joke oval acoustic badge engine ship chunk address front art dog wine toilet casual cost"
MNEMONIC_002="sport moon venture frozen deposit limb civil buzz remain recall mercy monitor soldier elbow lemon make motor observe inform hip coffee bacon eye way"
...
```

### Running

```bash
# in stardust-tools root directory
yarn tool:funds-spreader

# in stardust-tools/tools/funds-spreader
yarn execute
```

:::caution
Please be sure that your `.env` file mnemonics are set before running the tool, or else you **WILL** receive an error.
:::

The output will look something like this:

```bash

```

### Parameters

The funds spreader takes an array of objects (specifically [`IFundsSpreaderParameters[]`](https://github.com/maxwellmattryan/stardust-tools/blob/develop/tools/funds-spreader/src/interfaces/funds-spreader-parameters.interface.ts#L8){target=\_blank}) where each `IFundsSpreaderParameters` element contains the following arguments:

Required:

-   `mnemonic`: the seed used to generate the particular addresses
-   `addressDerivationCoinType`: the `coin_type` to use in the BIP32 path, e.g. `4218` (IOTA) or `4219` (Shimmer)
-   `addressEncodingCoinType`: the `coin_type`[^1] corresponding to the Bech32 HRP that is used in encoding the Ed25519 address, e.g. `atoi` or `rms`[^2]
-   `accountsFundsSpreadersParameters[]`: an array of per-account parameter objects that contain an `accountIndex` and an array of `addressIndicesWithFunds`

Optional:

-   `requestFundsFromFaucet`: a boolean value to indicate whether or not to actually send fund requests to the faucet, `true` by default
-   `backupToStrongholdFile`: a boolean value to indicate whether or not to backup each profile / account manager to a specific Stronghold backup file, `false` by default

#### Shimmer Claiming

By default, the tool is setup to use the specific parameters for Shimmer claiming (reason being that this tool was originally created for testing this functionality in Firefly).

Those parameters are located in [`stardust-tools/tools/funds-spreader/src/constants/funds-spreaders-parameters`](https://github.com/maxwellmattryan/stardust-tools/tree/develop/tools/funds-spreader/src/constants/funds-spreaders-parameters){target=\_blank}.

:::info
If you wish to change the `coin_type` parameter that the addresses are _derived_ (**NOT** _encoded_ as Stardust hasn't yet reached IOTA) with, then please edit [this line](https://github.com/maxwellmattryan/stardust-tools/blob/develop/tools/funds-spreader/src/constants/funds-spreaders-parameters/shimmer-claiming-funds-spreaders-parameters.ts#L173){target=\_blank}.
:::

#### Custom Scenarios

In some cases, it will be easier to create a new funds spreaders parameters file rather than editing an existing one.

Use the following steps to make sure the funds spreader works properly when using with custom scenarios:

1. Create a new TypeScript file in `stardust-tools/tools/funds-spreader/src/constants/funds-spreaders-parameters`
2. Properly declare and define a variable of type `IFundsSpreaderParameters[]` with the specific configuration
3. Barrel export your newly created file by adding another line in [`stardust-tools/tools/funds-spreader/src/constants/funds-spreaders-parameters/index.ts`](https://github.com/maxwellmattryan/stardust-tools/blob/develop/tools/funds-spreader/src/constants/funds-spreaders-parameters/index.ts){target=\_blank}
4. In `stardust-tools/tools/funds-spreader/src/main.ts`, please change [this line](https://github.com/maxwellmattryan/stardust-tools/blob/develop/tools/funds-spreader/src/main.ts#L9){target=\_blank}

[^1]:
The `coin_type` parameter is **NOT** technically relevant to how the address is encoded, only BIP32.
It used simply used here for convenience as both a user and developer of this tool.

[^2]:
Due to the way the funds spreader works (requesting funds from a faucet rather than making transfers of your own funds), it will **NOT** work for any mainnet funds (IOTA _or_ SMR).
Although this is a potential feature to add in the future, e.g. a `FundsSpreaderStrategy` that indicates how exactly to "spread funds" amongst addresses.
